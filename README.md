# crispcode-io

For a longtime this has just been my email domain, or domain to my portfolio site.
Now though, I'd like to treat this as an operating system for my life.

To start it will be a dashboard for the crispcode.io website where I can check 
- site activity
- upload blog posts in markdown format
- upload projects with demo urls, github links, and the projects readme

In the future I hope add a few things.
- connection to socials for automated uploads and engagement management
- connection to calendar and calendly 
- dropshipped merch store and management
