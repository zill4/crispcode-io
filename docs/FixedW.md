# FixedW/ Manifesto

The ultimate goal is to help people __confidently__ understand what work needs to be done on their car. 

__FixedW/__ let's you know how to do it yourself, or what you should be expecting of the mechanic.

One major hurdle with accurately recommending a fix for a car is knowing roughly how much a part might cost, and more importantly __which__ part you need. This is the __BIG HAIRY PROBLEM.__ 

The data for parts is walled off behind big organizations, is vast, unorganized, and expensive. Tackling know which exact part is needed for each car is not a viable solution for the MVP.

The value the FixedWith can add today without that information is connecting customers to local mechanics, part retailers, and dealerships.

We can make money by building the relationships between our users and these entities. Instead of spending ad-dollars with Google, mechanics, retailers, and dealerships can partner with us for featured recommendations to visit/contact their business.

We will focus on building a robust system that aggregates local businesses and recommends them for a solution. Think ZocDoc but for cars.

VISION

Longterm the objective is to build a reputable network of businesses that are ready and willing to serve customers with automotive issues. With the leverage and revenue generated from this network we will reinvest in the product improving the AIâ€™s ability to determine the EXACT parts, repair steps, and tools required to finish the job. Empowering our users to do it themselves, or be aware of exactly what the mechanic should be fixing. Conversely, working directly with mechanics could open a whole new potential business where we might solve that BIG HAIRY PROBLEM.


â€”
Ironically we going to lean into SOCIAL - MOBILE - LOCAL
- Connect with car communities in your area to help with your build.
- Find local businesses for repairs or mods.
- Share the work or damage youâ€™ve done to your car.

Start taking the 86 to the track and record it, maybe make a project for the 86 on fixing some issues yourself, the app should be your best friend the whole time. Release a video about the fix.

A profile on fixedw/ for sharing build progress

I often see videos where the wrong part is purchased. Checking numbers is important. Can we Tony Stark this shit? Like AR view the part, blow it up, inspect each part, part number, providers, best prices - put it all together and boom it expected DINO ðŸ¦– numbers?! 

Like the main bottleneck for that is a highly accessible API (prob graphql for dynamic queries), a many:many DB where one part that could be many different parts works with many different parts but those parts are also could be many different parts. An ai trained on this data could help route for would potentially be a very complicated solution to make. It could be considered somewhat like chess, each part could point to n more parts that could have a better price/performance ratio, providing that to the customer quickly and cheaply, I canâ€™t think of a better solution than using AI especially when it comes to all the variables involved.
